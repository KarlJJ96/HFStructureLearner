This provides the MATLAB to run the tool discussed in https://www.rpsonline.com.sg/proceedings/esrel2022/html/R12-12-372.xml

This tool is part of the Virtual Raphael collection developed for the Human Reliablity, Human Factors and related fields.

This tool learns the causal relationships between performance shaping factors from past accident data, which is the used to produce the network structure necessary for creating a Bayesian Network model.

The tool has both a score and a constraint based algorithm for determining these relationships/structures. The tool is also encoded with a table of relationships determined by an expert that can also be integraed in the output.
